                    project management, information technology, human resources, marketing,
                    international business, logistics and organizational behavior. These
                    competencies are flexible enough that upon graduation, careers in a variety
                    of different fields may be available. Students may initially be interested in
                    business administration because they feel they have leadership skills and
                    think they could be successful managing teams, but as they take courses they
                    discover there’s so much more to business administration than management.</li></div>
